## How To Install hehe
#### Clone the repository


#### Create your environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

_The app key is used to salt passwords. If you need to work with production data you'll want to use the same app key as defined in the .env file in production so password hashes match._

#### Update these settings in the .env file:

-   DB_DATABASE (your local database, i.e. "todo")
-   DB_USERNAME (your local db username, i.e. "root")
-   DB_PASSWORD (your local db password, i.e. "")

#### Install PHP dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```

_If you don't have Composer installed, [instructions here](https://getcomposer.org/)._

#### Generate an app key:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

#### Run the database migrations:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

#### Install Javascript dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

_If you don't have Node and NPM installed, [instructions here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)._

#### Run an initial build:

```bash
npm run development
```


## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
